Okay so this is a trial for how I should write/input the other future files. 
So it's gonna be messy and prob v long as I try to fig out how much I want to include (so far it's gonna b everything)
A lot of the stuff I comments is hard to rmb what they were (for), some is stuff I may need in future , some is prev ver of that part 
(so I can look back and rmb what doenst work)


grid_w = 5 #input('What is your grid side len? ')
grid_l = 5
bombs = 3

#def grid():
row1 = '   '
for i in range(grid_w):
    row1 += chr(65 + i) + ' '

print(row1)

global rows 
rows = []
for i in range(grid_l):
    row = ''
    row += ' ' + str(i+1) + ' '
    for j in range(grid_w):
        row += 'O '
    rows += [row]

for i in range(grid_l):
    print(rows[i])

board = user_board = list(rows)

bomb_locat = []

# X - chosen bomb
# x - user selection spot - when checking? 



#restarted to use simpler borad, using the board as str
grid_w = 5 #input('What is your grid side len? ')
grid_l = 5
bombs = 3

global grid
grid = ''
for i in range(grid_w*grid_l):
    grid += 'O '

print(grid, len(grid))

#def grid():
row1 = '   ' #for the top hori header w letters
for i in range(grid_w):
    row1 += chr(65 + i) + ' '

print()
print(row1)

#global rows 
rows = []
idx = 0
for i in range(grid_l):
    row = ''
    row += ' ' + str(i+1) + ' ' #for the vert num header
    row += grid[idx:idx+2*grid_w]
    idx += 2*grid_w
    rows += [row]

for i in range(grid_l): 
    print(rows[i])

board = user_board = list(rows)

bomb_locat = []



#then in the end I edited(bc I think this is long enouhg for juts abt the grid) and settled on(at least for now):
grid_w = 5 #input('What is your grid width? ')
grid_l = 5 #input('What is your grid len? ')
bombs = 3 #input('Number of bombs? ')
#need to check for int i/p later
#oh and prob need to cr8 random generator
# - diff lvls? 

global grid
grid = ''
for i in range(grid_w*grid_l):
    grid += 'â–  '

print(grid, len(grid))


#def grid():
row1 = '   ' #for the top hori header w letters

#global rows

    row = ''

    idx += 2*grid_w
    rows += [row]
