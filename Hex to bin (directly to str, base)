# String version
# in the sense that i directly converted the hex to binary (which is
# formatted as a string)
#start: 29 aug 2021
#end: 29 aug (the base code at least, who knows if ill come back to this)

# honestly not rly needed but i guess it might be btr for the prgm to 
# handle less data. Plus the code juts below removes anything thats
