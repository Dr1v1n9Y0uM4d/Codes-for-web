# Typically I would indicate how the output is given eg (string) or (list)
# But sometimes I'd get lazy and just write (s) or (l) 
# So don't be shocked if that happens
# And before you start booing, it sometimes is to make space for additional comments of sorts 
# (in the sense that the name wouldn't be too long)
# eg: (s, end) - this would be how my code that have features are named
